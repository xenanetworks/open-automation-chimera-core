Introduction
============

The :term:`XOA Chimera Core` is a Python library that provides a user-friendly and powerful interface for automating network impairment emulation tasks using Xena Networks Emulator, `Chimera <https://xenanetworks.com/chimera/>`_.

The XOA Chimera Core is designed to be easy to use and integrate with other automation tools and frameworks. It provides a comprehensive set of methods and classes for interacting with Chimera, including the ability to create and run complex impairment scenarios.

The XOA Chimera Core simplifies the process of automating network impairment emulation tasks. It provides a simple, yet powerful, interface for interacting with Chimera using the Python programming language. With the XOA Chimera Core, testing professionals can easily create and execute network impairment scenarios, analyze traffic, and perform detailed analysis of 5G ORAN, all while leveraging the power and flexibility of the Python programming language.

Overall, the XOA Chimera Core is a valuable tool for anyone looking to automate their network emulation tasks using Xena Chimera. With its simple, yet powerful, interface and support for the Python programming language, the XOA Chimera Core provides a set of flexible and extensible APIs for automating network emulation and improving the quality of network infrastructure.

    Chimera is a network impairment emulator that makes it easy to introduce consistent, accurate, well-defined and repeatable impairments (e.g. packet manipulation, packet drop, latency and jitter) to traffic between DUTs in the lab. All rates from 10GE to 100GE are supported by a single 2-slot test module.

    Chimera is ideal for NEMs who want to optimize Quality of Experience (QoE) for customers by ensuring equipment can handle acceptable levels of impairment. Service providers, enterprises, and government agencies can also use Chimera
    to validate Quality of Service (QoS) for voice, video, and data traffic being sent
    across their networks.

    Chimera can be installed as a test module in a ValkyrieBay chassis for seamless integration with `ValkyrieManager <https://xenanetworks.com/product/valkyriemanager/>`_. This provides a simple way to impair traffic being generated by Valkyrie from within the same UI - a unique feature for Chimera. Or it is available in a compact chassis for use as a standalone solution for emulating impairment on traffic between two DUTs.

    Chimera can also be controlled using `XOA CLI <https://docs.xenanetworks.com/projects/xoa-cli>`_, a simple and easy to use command-line-interface scripting API making test automation easy and fast. The result is a cost-effective and powerful network impairment emulator solution for benchmarking, stress testing/negative testing, "what-if" testing, and regression testing.
